# EEE/CSE499: Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression

### Overview

In this project , we will predict a patientâ€™s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. We will determine lung function based on output from a spirometer, which measures the volume of air inhaled and exhaled. The challenge is to use deep learning techniques to make a prediction with the image, metadata, and baseline FVC as input.
