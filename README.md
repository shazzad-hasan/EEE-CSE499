# EEE/CSE499: Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression

### Overview

In this project , we will predict a patientâ€™s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. We will determine lung function based on output from a spirometer, which measures the volume of air inhaled and exhaled. The challenge is to use deep learning techniques to make a prediction with the image, metadata, and baseline FVC as input.

### Pulmonary fibrosis
Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic interstitial lung disease that occurs due to gradual irreparable lung tissue scarring and damage over time. As the disease worsens, loss in lung capacity increases, and the patient becomes progressively more short of breath. There is no known cure and limited treatment options available, but early diagnosis without surgical lung biopsy is crucial for the treatment and management. The most promising method in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis is the assessment of lung function decline based on computed tomography (CT) imaging. However, identification and characterization of pulmonary fibrosis is sometimes difficult for the general radiologist and even for the subspecialist radiologist, due to the low frequency of such cases and numerous types of interstitial lung diseases.
