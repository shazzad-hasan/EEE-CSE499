# EEE-CSE499: Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression

### Pulmonary Fibrosis
Pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease that occurs when lung tissue becomes damaged and scarred. This thickened, stiff tissue makes it more difficult for your lungs to work properly. If you want to know further about this type lung disease, I have linked below an informative video.

### Goal of This Project
The aim of this project is to predict a patientâ€™s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (FVC), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.
